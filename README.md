# LLM-Enhanced Formal Concept Analysis: A Novel Approach to Semantic Mapping and Knowledge Discovery
This project is currently under active development and is being supervised by [Dr. Sergei Obiedkov](https://iccl.inf.tu-dresden.de/web/Sergei_Obiedkov/en)

## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1. Objective

The goal is to analyze linguistic data (e.g., cross-linguistic meanings and lexical groupings) using FCA and then **verify the resulting implications** through LLMs. These implications capture logical patterns such as:

- **Attribute implications**:  
  > If a verb expresses meanings A and B, then it also expresses C.

- **Object implications**:  
  > If meanings A and B co-occur in certain lexical items, they also appear in others.

The system supports exploration and verification of **both types**, giving users full control over how they interrogate the conceptual structure of the data.

### 1.2. Methodology

The project follows a two-step process:

1. **Formal Concept Analysis** is applied to lexical typology data to generate a set of implications (attribute-based and object-based).
2. These implications are then validated by a **Large Language Model**, with support for various user interaction modes.

### 1.3. Validation Modes

Three verification modes have been developed, each suited to different levels of automation:

#### 1.3.1. Manual Mode
- The user manually validates each implication using their own linguistic knowledge.
- Ideal for experts seeking precise control.

#### 1.3.2. Assisted Mode
- The LLM provides proposed answers and justifications.
- Users can **interactively chat** with the system:
  - Ask follow-up questions
  - Challenge the model
  - Refine or explore counterexamples
- Useful for guided, collaborative research.

#### 1.3.3. Automated Mode
- Operates with minimal user input.
- Automatically validates implications until:
  - All implications are resolved, or
  - A user-defined limit (e.g., *X* implications) is reached.
- Suitable for large-scale or batch validation tasks.


By combining **formal logic from FCA** with the **reasoning abilities of LLMs**, this system offers a powerful toolkit for scalable, explainable, and interactive analysis of semantic structure in language data‚Äîsupporting both **attribute** and **object exploration** modes.

## 2. Background: Formal Concept Analysis (FCA)

**Formal Concept Analysis (FCA)** is a mathematical framework for data analysis that focuses on identifying and visualizing relationships between a set of **objects** and a set of **attributes**. Developed by Rudolf Wille in the early 1980s, FCA is grounded in **lattice theory** and is widely used in knowledge representation, data mining, and ontology engineering.

### 2.1. Formal Context

Think of this as a simple table showing "what has what" - like a spreadsheet where rows are objects, columns are attributes, and checkmarks shows that this specific attribute is present in that object.

formally, A **formal context** in FCA is a triple: 

K = (G, M, I)

Where:
- **G** is a set of **objects**
- **M** is a set of **attributes**
- **I** is a binary relation (subset of G √ó M) indicating which object has which attribute  
  (i.e., (g, m) ‚àà I means object *g* has attribute *m*)

For example concider the below formal concept which represents a small set of **person categories** based on their **gender** and **age group**.:


|        Object        | Female | Male | Juvenile | Adult |
|:--------------------:|:------:|:----:|:--------:|:-----:|
| **girl**             |   ‚úîÔ∏è   |      |    ‚úîÔ∏è    |       |
| **woman**            |   ‚úîÔ∏è   |      |          |  ‚úîÔ∏è   |
| **boy**              |        |  ‚úîÔ∏è  |    ‚úîÔ∏è    |       |
| **man**              |        |  ‚úîÔ∏è  |          |  ‚úîÔ∏è   |

^Taken from [upriss.github.io](https://upriss.github.io/fca/fcaintro.html)


In this context the **Objects** are `girl`, `woman`, `boy`, `man` and the **Attributes** are `female`, `male`, `juvenile`, `adult`. Each object is described by the attributes that apply to it, like A **girl** is **female** and **juvenile**

This setup defines a simple logical structure where each object can be classified by its gender and age. It allows us to explore patterns and relationships‚Äîlike grouping all **juveniles**, all **females**, or all **adults**‚Äîbased on shared attributes.


### 2.2. Formal Concepts

A **formal concept** is a pair:

(A, B)

Where:
- **A** ‚äÜ G is the **extent** (the set of objects sharing the attributes in B)
- **B** ‚äÜ M is the **intent** (the set of attributes common to all objects in A)

These satisfy the following conditions:

A = { g ‚àà G | ‚àÄ m ‚àà B: (g, m) ‚àà I }

B = { m ‚àà M | ‚àÄ g ‚àà A: (g, m) ‚àà I }

From our context, below are some formal concepts can be derived:

1. **({girl}, {female, juvenile})**  
2. **({woman}, {female, adult})**  
3. **({boy}, {male, juvenile})**  
4. **({man}, {male, adult})**  

These concepts form the building blocks of the **concept lattice**, which organizes them hierarchically based on shared attributes and object groupings.

These formal concepts form a **concept lattice**, which reveals hierarchical relationships among concepts.

For our example we get the below lattice daigram

### 2.3. Attribute Implications and Attribute exploration 

An **attribute implication** is a rule of the form:

X ‚Üí Y

Where X, Y ‚äÜ M. This means:

> If an object has all the attributes in set X, then it also has all the attributes in set Y.

These implications capture dependencies between attributes and can be used for reasoning and data compression. FCA provides tools to compute a minimal (canonical) set of such implications, known as the **Duquenne‚ÄìGuigues basis**.

> **Attribute Exploration** is a procedure in which we ask a expert is this implication ùëã ‚Üí ùëå valid? The expert then has two options. Either, the expert accepts ùëã ‚Üí ùëå as a valid implication in the domain, or, he refutes the implication. In the latter case the expert is obliged to present a counter example in the ‚Äúlanguage‚Äù of the domain, i.e., an object described by the attributes from ùëÄ (initial context).

### 2.4. Object Implications

**Object implications** are less commonly used and arise in the **dual** setting of FCA:

A ‚Üí B

Where A, B ‚äÜ G. This means:

> If all objects in A share certain attributes, then the same holds for objects in B.

While analogous to attribute implications, object implications are mainly explored in theoretical extensions of FCA.

> **Object Exploration** is also done in a similar manner as the attribute exploration .

## 3. Data Description: Lexical Typology

The dataset used in this project comes from the field of **Lexical Typology**, a branch of linguistic typology that studies how different languages categorize and lexicalize concepts across the **semantic space**.

### 3.1. Context

While:
- **Phonological typology** focuses on the sound systems (phonemes) of languages
- **Grammatical typology** deals with morphological patterns and word forms

**Lexical typology** explores **how languages structure word meanings**, especially how they split or merge conceptual domains.

### 3.2. Example: The Word *Thick*

In English, the adjective *thick* can describe:
- Dimensional size (e.g., *thick wall*, *thick stick*)
- Substance consistency (e.g., *thick porridge*)

However, in Russian, these meanings are split between two distinct words:
- **—Ç–æ–ª—Å—Ç—ã–π (*tolstyj*)**: for dimensional size (*—Ç–æ–ª—Å—Ç–∞—è —Å—Ç–µ–Ω–∞* ‚Äì thick wall)
- **–≥—É—Å—Ç–æ–π (*gustoj*)**: for consistency (*–≥—É—Å—Ç–∞—è –∫–∞—à–∞* ‚Äì thick porridge)

This demonstrates how **semantic domains** are divided differently across languages.

### 3.3. Example of actual dataset

A sample of the actual data used in our analysis is shown below.

## 4. UI Screenshots

### 4.1. File Upload Page

The initial screen allows users to upload their context files to the system. Supported formats include Excel (.xlsx), CSV (.csv), and CXT (.cxt). Users can select a file from their device, which the system then processes for further analysis. 

<img width="1582" height="961" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-14 at 11 49 56‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d3fb5a3-2751-4a77-8bb7-f6d3babefb33" />

The user can also select using the slider which rows and columns to use for analysis.

<img width="1582" height="961" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-14 at 11 57 09‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c3cdd222-f9fd-4ed2-9ad6-ece33075eda7" />

### After the initial file upload, user can then select among attribute exploration or object exploration.

### 4.2. Attribute Exploration

#### 4.2.1 Manual Mode
At first the system shows a implication (which can be selected from the right hand side, but shows the first implication by default)
<img width="1582" height="961" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-14 at 11 57 48‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5962575e-1c57-41b1-aa91-f92e974c0db8" />

If user confirmed implication it will be added to the confirmed implication section on the right hand side

<img width="1582" height="961" alt="Screenshot 2025-07-14 at 11 59 23‚ÄØPM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4526c904-eeb1-44ac-ba1c-923650a23632" />

If the user rejects the implication, the system asks for a counter example, if the counter example is a valid counter example then the object will be added to the context else the relevant exception will be shown by the system
