# LLM-Enhanced Formal Concept Analysis: A Novel Approach to Semantic Mapping and Knowledge Discovery
This project is currently under active development and is being supervised by of [Dr. Sergei Obiedkov](https://iccl.inf.tu-dresden.de/web/Sergei_Obiedkov/en)

## Background: Formal Concept Analysis (FCA)

**Formal Concept Analysis (FCA)** is a mathematical framework for data analysis that focuses on identifying and visualizing relationships between a set of **objects** and a set of **attributes**. Developed by Rudolf Wille in the early 1980s, FCA is grounded in **lattice theory** and is widely used in knowledge representation, data mining, and ontology engineering.

### Formal Context

A **formal context** in FCA is a triple:
K = (G, M, I)

Where:
- **G** is a set of **objects**
- **M** is a set of **attributes**
- **I** is a binary relation (subset of G × M) indicating which object has which attribute  
  (i.e., (g, m) ∈ I means object *g* has attribute *m*)

### Formal Concepts

A **formal concept** is a pair:
